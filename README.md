# sentiment-analysis

This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on textual data using machine learning techniques. The model classifies the sentiment of the input text into different categories such as Positive, Negative, and Neutral.

Features


Text Preprocessing: The project includes various preprocessing steps like tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal.
Sentiment Classification: It uses machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or other classification algorithms.
Visualization: Provides visualizations to show the sentiment distribution of the text data.
Requirements
Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
nltk
You can install them using pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
You can use any text dataset for sentiment analysis, such as Twitter data, product reviews, or movie reviews. The dataset should contain a text column and a corresponding label column representing sentiment categories.

How to Use
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/arpanrai223/sentiment-analysis.git
cd sentiment-analysis
Preprocess the text data:

Use the preprocess.py script to clean and preprocess the data. This step includes removing unwanted characters, stopwords, and other text normalization tasks.

bash
Copy
Edit
python preprocess.py
Train the model:

Use the train_model.py script to train the sentiment analysis model on the preprocessed data.

bash
Copy
Edit
python train_model.py
Evaluate the model:

After training the model, you can evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

bash
Copy
Edit
python evaluate_model.py
Run predictions:

Use the trained model to predict sentiments for new texts using the predict.py script.

bash
Copy
Edit
python predict.py --text "Your text here"
